# Trade in the Decentralized Exchange

This code demonstrates how to buy a fungible token on the XRP Ledger's decentralized exchange (DEX). For a detailed explanation of how to trade using the DEX, see <https://xrpl.org/trade-in-the-decentralized-exchange.html>.

The code is designed to run in a browser by loading `demo.html` and watching the console output, or in Node.js. For Node.js, you must first install the dependencies using your preferred package manager (such as `yarn` or `npm`).
